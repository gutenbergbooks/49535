<h2><a name="CHARLES_KINGSLEY_AT_HOME" id="CHARLES_KINGSLEY_AT_HOME">CHARLES KINGSLEY AT HOME.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> who had the pleasure of knowing the Rev.
Charles Kingsley, author of <i>Hypatia</i>, <i>Westward
Ho</i>, and <i>Alton Locke</i>, will acknowledge that however
great he was as a parish clergyman, poet,
novelist, naturalist, sportsman, he was greater still
at home. And how was this greatness shewn? By
his self-denying efforts to give joy to his wife and
children, and chivalrously to take away from them
whatever was painful. No man ever excelled him
in the quality of being 'thoroughly domesticated.'
In actual life we fear this is a rare attainment, for
it is nothing less than the flower that indicates perfectly
developed manhood or womanhood. This
flower beautified and sweetened Canon Kingsley's
life. He <i>was</i> a hero to those who had greater opportunities
of knowing him than have most valets.
Whatever unheroic cynics may say of the disenchanting
power of intimacy, there was an exception
in his case. How much such an example should
teach us all! Not one in ten thousand can hope
to become the many-sided man Kingsley was, but
none of us need despair of making that little
corner of the world called 'home' brighter and
happier, as he made Eversley Rectory. We can all
make our homes sweet if, when company-clothes
are doffed, we clothe the most ordinary and commonplace
duties of home-life with good temper
and cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Because the Rectory-house was on low ground,
the rector of Eversley, who considered violation of
the divine laws of health a sort of acted blasphemy,
built his children an outdoor nursery on
the 'Mount,' where they kept books, toys, and tea-things,
spending long happy days on the highest
and loveliest point of moorland in the glebe;
and there he would join them when his parish
work was done, bringing them some fresh treasure
picked up in his walk, a choice wild-flower or fern
or rare beetle, sometimes a lizard or a field-mouse;
ever waking up their sense of wonder, calling out
their powers of observation, and teaching them
lessons out of God's great green book, <i>without their
knowing</i> they were learning. Out-of-doors and
indoors, the Sundays were the happiest days of
the week to the children, though to their father
the hardest. When his day's work was done, there
was always the Sunday walk, in which each bird
and plant and brook was pointed out to the
children, as preaching sermons to Eyes, such
as were not even dreamt of by people of the No-eyes
species. Indoors the Sunday picture-books
were brought out, and each child chose its subject
for the father to draw, either some Bible story, or
bird or beast or flower. In all ways he fostered in
his children a love of animals. They were taught
to handle without disgust toads, frogs, beetles, as
works from the hand of a living God. His guests
were surprised one morning at breakfast when
his little girl ran up to the open window of the
dining-room holding a long repulsive-looking worm
in her hand: 'O daddy, look at this <i>delightful</i>
worm!'</p>

<p>Kingsley had a horror of corporal punishment,
not merely because it tends to produce antagonism
between parent and child, but because he considered
more than half the lying of children to be
the result of fear of punishment. 'Do not train a
child,' he said, 'as men train a horse, by letting
anger and punishment be the <i>first</i> announcement
of his having sinned. If you do, you induce two
bad habits: first, the boy regards his parent with
a kind of blind dread, as a being who may be
offended by actions which to <i>him</i> are innocent, and
whose wrath he expects to fall upon him at any
moment in his most pure and unselfish happiness.
Next, and worst still, the boy learns not to fear
sin, but the punishment of it, and thus he learns
to lie.' He was careful too not to confuse his
children by a multiplicity of small rules. 'It is
difficult enough to keep the Ten Commandments,'
he would say, 'without making an eleventh in
every direction.' He had no 'moods' with his
family, for he cultivated, by strict self-discipline in
the midst of worries and pressing business, a disengaged
temper, that always enabled him to enter
into other people's interests, and especially into
children's playfulness. 'I wonder,' he would say,
'if there is so much laughing in any other home in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">{498}</a></span>
England as in ours.' He became a light-hearted
boy in the presence of his children, or when exerting
himself to cheer up his aged mother who lived
with him. When nursery griefs and broken toys
were taken to his study, he was never too busy to
mend the toy and dry the tears. He held with Jean
Paul Richter, that children have their 'days and
hours of rain,' which parents should not take much
notice of, either for anxiety or sermons, but should
lightly pass over, except when they are symptoms
of coming illness. And his knowledge of physiology
enabled him to detect such symptoms. He
recognised the fact, that weariness at lessons and
sudden fits of obstinacy are not hastily to be
treated as moral delinquencies, springing as they
so often do from physical causes, which are best
counteracted by cessation from work and change
of scene.</p>

<p>How blessed is the son who can speak of his
father as Charles Kingsley's eldest son does.
'"Perfect love casteth out fear," was the motto,'
he says, 'on which my father based his theory of
bringing up children. From this and from the
interest he took in their pursuits, their pleasures,
trials, and even the petty details of their everyday
life, there sprang up a friendship between father
and children, that increased in intensity and depth
with years. To speak for myself, he was the best
friend&mdash;the only true friend I ever had. At once
he was the most fatherly and the most unfatherly
of fathers&mdash;fatherly in that he was our intimate
friend and our self-constituted adviser; unfatherly
in that our feeling for him lacked that fear and
restraint that make boys call their father "the
governor." Ours was the only household I ever
saw in which there was no favouritism. It seemed
as if in each of our different characters he took an
equal pride, while he fully recognised their different
traits of good or evil; for instead of having one
code of social, moral, and physical laws laid down
for one and all of us, each child became a separate
study for him; and its little "diseases au moral,"
as he called them, were treated differently according
to each different temperament.... Perhaps the
brightest picture of the past that I look back to
now is the drawing-room at Eversley in the evenings,
when we were all at home and by ourselves.
There he sat, with one hand in mother's, forgetting
his own hard work in leading our fun and frolic,
with a kindly smile on his lips, and a loving light
in that bright gray eye, that made us feel that, in
the broadest sense of the word, he was our father.'</p>

<p>Of this son, when he was an undergraduate at
Cambridge, his father (then Professor of History)
writes: 'Ah! what a blessing to be able to help
him at last by teaching him something one's-self.'
And to a learned 'F.G.S.' he says very seriously:
'My eldest son is just going off to try his manhood
in Colorado, United States. You will understand,
therefore, that it is somewhat important to me just
now whether the world be ruled by a just and
wise God or by 0. It is also important to me
with regard to my own boy's future, whether what
is said to have happened to-morrow (Good Friday)
be true or false.' In this way Kingsley educated
his heart and became truly wise. For no matter
how extensive may be our stock of information, we
cannot be called wise unless heart become to head
a helpmate.</p>

<p>And how well he used his matrimony&mdash;a state
that should be to all the means of highest culture,
or 'grace.' Sympathising with a husband's
anxiety, he once wrote to a friend: 'I believe one
never understands the blessed mystery of marriage
till one has nursed a sick wife, nor understands
either what treasures women are.' He believed in
the eternity of marriage. 'So well and really
married on earth' did he think himself, that in one
of his letters he writes: 'If I do not love my wife
body and soul as well there as I do here, then
there is neither resurrection of my body nor of my
soul, but of some other, and I shall not be I.' And
again in another letter: 'If immortality is to
include in my case identity of person, I shall feel
to her for ever what I feel now. That feeling may
be developed in ways which I do not expect; it
may have provided for it forms of expression very
different from any which are among the holiest
sacraments of life.... Will not one of the properties
of the spiritual body be, that it will be able to
express that which the natural body only tries to
express?'</p>

<p>Kingsley and his future wife met for the first
time when he was only twenty years of age in
Oxfordshire, where he was spending his college
vacation. 'That was my real wedding-day,' he
used always to say. The Cambridge undergraduate
was at the time going through the crisis in a young
man's life that may be called without irreverence
'moral measles.' He was then full of religious
doubts; and his face, with its unsatisfied hungering
look, bore witness to the state of his mind. He
told her his doubts, and she told him her faith;
and the positive, being stronger than the negative,
so prevailed that he was no longer faithless but
believing. Hitherto his peculiar character had not
been understood, and his heart had been half
asleep. It woke up now, and never slept again.
For the first time he could speak with perfect
freedom, and be met with answering sympathy.
And gradually, as the new friendship deepened
into intimacy, every doubt, every thought, every
failing, every sin was laid bare. Counsel was
asked and given; and as new hopes dawned, the
look of hard defiance gave way to a wonderful
humility and tenderness, which were his characteristics,
with those who understood him, to his
dying day. 'My memory often runs back,' writes
an early friend of his, 'to the days when I used
to meet dear Kingsley in his little curate rooms;
when he told me of his attachment to one whom
he feared he should never be able to marry.' But
things turning out brighter than he expected, the
same friend records how, calling at his cottage one
morning, 'I found him almost beside himself,
stamping his things into a portmanteau. "What is
the matter, dear Kingsley?"&mdash;"I am engaged. I
am going to see her <i>now</i>&mdash;to-day."'</p>

<p>His chivalrous idea of wedlock was only natural,
for he always attributed to Mrs Kingsley's sympathy
and influence his success, saying that never
but for her would he have become a writer.
Writing to a friend on the subject of marriage,
he says that it is his duty to hold the highest
and most spiritual views, 'for God has shewed me
these things in an eventful and blissful marriage
history, and woe to me if I preach them not.'</p>

<p>Writing to his wife from the sea-side, where
he had gone in search of health, he says:
'This place is perfect; but it seems a dream and
imperfect without you. Kiss the darling ducks of
children for me. How I long after them and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">{499}</a></span>
prattle. I delight in all the little ones in the
street, for their sake, and continually I start and
fancy I hear their voices outside. You do not
know how I love them; nor did I hardly till I
came here. Absence quickens love into consciousness.'&mdash;'Blessed
be God for the rest, though I
never before felt the loneliness of being without
the beloved being whose every look, and word,
and motion are the key-notes of my life. People
talk of love ending at the altar.... Fools! I lay
at the window all morning, thinking of nothing
but home; how I long for it!'&mdash;'Tell Rose and
Maurice that I have got two pair of bucks' horns&mdash;one
for each of them, huge old fellows, almost as
big as baby.'</p>

<p>Writing from France to 'my dear little man,' as
he calls his youngest son (for whom he wrote the
<i>Water Babies</i>), he says: 'There is a little Egyptian
vulture here in the inn; ask mother to shew you
his picture in the beginning of the Bird book.'
When smarting from severe attacks on his historical
teaching at Cambridge, he could write to his
wife: 'I have been very unhappy about your
unhappiness about me, and cannot bear to think of
your having a pang on my account.' From America
he writes: 'My digestion is perfect, and I am
in high spirits. But I am home-sick at times, and
would give a finger to be one hour with you and
G. and M.'</p>

<p>From such things; which, though they may
appear little, are really the great things of life, or
at least its <i>heart's ease</i>, Canon Kingsley got power
to do and to suffer.</p>

<p>Coming out from service in Westminster Abbey,
he caught a cold; but he made light of it, for he
could think of nothing but the joy of returning
with his wife to Eversley for Christmas and the
quiet winter's work. No sooner had they returned
home than Mrs Kingsley became seriously ill.
On being told that her life was in the greatest
danger, Kingsley said: 'My own death-warrant
was signed with those words.' His ministrations
in his wife's sick-room shewed the intensity of his
faith, as he strengthened the weak, encouraged the
fearful speaking of an eternal reunion, of the indestructibility
of that married love, which if genuine
on earth, could only, he thought, be severed for a
brief moment.</p>

<p>At this time Kingsley was himself ill, and on the
28th December he had to take to his bed, for
symptoms of pneumonia came on rapidly. The
weather was bitter, and he had been warned that
his recovery depended on the same temperature
being kept up in his bedroom and on his never
leaving it; but one day he indiscreetly leaped
out of bed, came into his wife's room for a few
moments, and taking her hand in his, he said:
'This is heaven; don't speak;' but after a short
silence, a severe fit of coughing came on, he could
say nothing more, and they never met again. For
a few days the sick husband and wife wrote to
each other in pencil, but it then became 'too
painful, too tantalising,' and the letters ceased.
A few days after this, the preacher, poet, novelist,
naturalist died, January 23, 1875, and was universally
lamented, for England had lost one of her
most estimable men&mdash;not great, in the ordinary
sense of the word, for Kingsley could lay no
claim to be a profound thinker. His philanthropy
confused his perceptions, as when in his writings
he denounced large towns and mill-owners, and
proposed to restore the population to the land.
Such 'socialism' as this would throw us back into
ignorance and poverty, instead of solving the difficult
modern problem of rich and poor. Kingsley
was great only as regards the feelings. There he
may be said to have made his mark.</p>

<p>How many of Charles Kingsley's works will
last? Some (with whom he himself would probably
have agreed) think that <i>Hypatia</i> and a few
songs, such as the <i>Sands of Dee</i> and <i>Three
Fishers</i>, are his only contributions to English
literature likely to endure. It may be that he had
too many irons in the fire for any of them to
become white-hot. We prefer to think of him as
a minister of the Gospel, who not only preached
piety but shewed it at home, by being a dutiful
son, a wise father, and a husband whose love
during thirty-six years 'never stooped from its
lofty level to a hasty word, an impatient gesture,
or a selfish act, in sickness or in health, in sunshine
or in storm, by day or by night.'</p>

<p>'He was a true and perfect knight,' is our
verdict, on rising from the perusal of his biography.
It is surely a great encouragement to
think that all who cultivate their hearts may,
without his genius, hope to imitate the home-virtues
of one who, however great in other respects,
was, in our opinion, greater at home.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LAST_OF_THE_HADDONS" id="THE_LAST_OF_THE_HADDONS">THE LAST OF THE HADDONS.</a></h2>

<p class='ph3'>CHAPTER XXXVI.&mdash;WAGES.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the bride and bridegroom were gone,
occurred the first slip in my behaviour. The rest
of the company had returned to the house, and I
suppose I must have stood in the road&mdash;gazing in
the direction the carriage had taken, the sound of
the distant bells floating faintly towards me in the
summer air&mdash;so long as to be unconscious of the
lapse of time, when gently and lightly a hand was
laid upon mine, and it was drawn under Robert
Wentworth's arm.</p>

<p>'You are wanted up there, Mary,' he said cheerfully.
'Mrs Tipper does not, I think, find herself
quite equal to Mrs Dallas and Mrs Trafford; to
say nothing of two discontented bride's-maids, and
a father who came here under protest, and was
only allowed to perform half the duty he came to
perform. You took that out of his hands, you
know; the giving away was virtually yours.' Going
on to talk amusingly of the incongruous materials
which went to make up the wedding-party, and
so giving me time to recover my self-command.
It was very soon put to the test. There was, to
begin with, some pretty banter from Mrs Chichester
to parry, when we reached the green terrace,
where the guests were sitting, to enjoy the air and
lovely view, and from which I suddenly remembered
they could see the part of the road where I
had been standing.</p>

<p>'We began to fear you must be ill, Miss Haddon,
seeing you stand so long motionless in the road.
It was quite a relief to see you move at last when
Mr Wentworth joined you&mdash;it really was!'</p>

<p>Probably Robert Wentworth considered that this
kind of thing was what I required, for he left me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">{500}</a></span>
to it, and devoted himself to the not very easy
task of trying to reconcile the two pretty bride's-maids;
gravely listening to their assurances that
the whole affair had been shockingly mismanaged
from first to last! I soon had enough to do to
reply to the patter of questions with which I was
assailed from Marian and Mrs Chichester.</p>

<p>Where in the world had I been hiding myself
all these months? Had I really come into a large
fortune, and turned Mr Dallas off, as people said;
or was it the other thing? As I did not know
what 'the other thing' was, I could not answer for
that; but acknowledged to having been fortunate;
smiling to myself as I wondered what they would
think of my idea of good fortune. Of course they
would know what my real position was in time;
but for the present I was mischievous enough to
let them imagine any improbable thing they
pleased. But there was one thing which they
must not be allowed to have any doubt about, and
that was my regard for Philip and Lilian, and
hearty concurrence in the marriage.</p>

<p>'I am <i>so</i> glad&mdash;so very glad; because we can
now speak very decidedly upon the point. People
are so terribly unkind and censorious; are they
not, Miss Haddon?'</p>

<p>'Some are, Mrs Chichester; yet I think, on the
whole, censorious people do a great deal less mischief
than they are supposed to do. My experience
is happily small in such matters; but I
believe that censorious people are generally well
known to be so, and therefore they are not capable
of doing much harm.'</p>

<p>'Then it was <i>not</i> true, Miss Haddon; I am so
very pleased to be able to say so!'</p>

<p>'What was not true, Mrs Chichester?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I would rather not repeat, really.'</p>

<p>'Well, I only know Caroline says she's heard it
said over and over again that you ran away in
despair, because you found that Mr Dallas and
Lilian were untrue to you,' said Marian, less
scrupulous about repeating than the other.</p>

<p>'That is really too ridiculous!' I ejaculated.&mdash;'But
you will be able to tell your friend or friends
that you did not see a love-lorn damsel to-day,
Mrs Chichester;' gazing at her with steady calm
eyes.</p>

<p>'You certainly don't look a bit love-lorn,'
candidly said Marian.</p>

<p>'O no,' chimed in Mrs Chichester. 'If you
will pardon the jest, I might say you looked a
great deal more as though you had <i>found</i> a lover,
than lost one!' with a meaning glance in Robert
Wentworth's direction.</p>

<p>'Will you excuse my asking if you had that
dress direct from Paris, Miss Haddon?' inquired
Marian.</p>

<p>'Paris? No; it came from Madame Michaux,'
I replied, happily recollecting that Jane had mentioned
that name.</p>

<p>'Oh, that is the same thing; isn't it? She
charges enormously; but one is quite sure of
having just the right thing from her. I suppose
you have all your dresses from her now?'</p>

<p>'No; not all,' I said, smiling at the remembrance
of my every-day attire.</p>

<p>'They say brown is to be the new colour: the
Duchess of Meck&mdash;Meck&mdash;&mdash; (What's her name,
Caroline? those German names are <i>so</i> absurd)&mdash;is
wearing nothing else but brown at Homburg.'</p>

<p>'I have been wearing brown some time,' I
replied, almost laughing outright.</p>

<p>'Some people always contrive to be in advance
of the fashions,' she said a little disconcertedly.&mdash;'Are
they going away already, Caroline; just
inquire if the carriage is there, will you?&mdash;I
see you have drab liveries, Miss Haddon; ours
is changed to claret; the Marchioness of'&mdash;&mdash; Breaking
off to make a reply to a few words from
the little bride's-maids, who with their father were
taking themselves off from the uncongenial atmosphere.
'O yes; went off very nicely indeed;
did it not? I wanted them to have the breakfast
at Fairview, or at anyrate to have two or three of
the men-servants to wait. But the party is small
certainly, and everything has been very well contrived.
No one is inclined to be very critical at
such times. I hope you will be able to come
down to Fairview before you return to Cornwall;
any time which may suit you best. You need not
write; we are always prepared for visitors.'</p>

<p>Both sisters hurriedly explained that their stay
in town would be very short, and that there was
not the <i>slightest</i> chance of their having a spare
day.</p>

<p>Then there was one other little trial of my
nerves&mdash;the few words which had to be spoken to
Mr and Mrs Dallas; but pride came to my assistance,
and I got through it pretty well, bearing
their curious looks and gracious speeches with at
anyrate apparent stoicism. Under other circumstances,
I might have been somewhat amused by
Mr Dallas's remark, that for his part he wished I
had not thrown Philip over; accompanied as it
was by a comprehensive glance at 'my carriage'
waiting in the road below.</p>

<p>As soon as they left, I felt at liberty to whisper
a loving good-bye to dear old Mrs Tipper, with a
promise to see her and clear up all mysteries on
the morrow, and take my departure. In a matter-of-course
way, Robert Wentworth walked with me
down the path, talking in the old pleasant easy
fashion until he had put me into the carriage.
Then just as I was bending forward to say the
one word 'Home,' he gave the order 'Greybrook
Hall.'</p>

<p>'Wait, John.'</p>

<p>The man stood aside; and I added to Robert
Wentworth: 'You know then?'</p>

<p>'Of course I know,' he replied with a quiet
smile.</p>

<p>I shrank back. He made a gesture to the footman,
gave me the orthodox bow, and I was driven
away.</p>

<p>Not a little agitated, I asked myself how much
more did he know&mdash;all? If he recognised me
that night in the wood, he did know not only
what I had done, but what it had cost me to do
it! I was no heroine; I have shewn myself as I
was on Philip's wedding-day; but I had not won
my peace without many a weary struggle for it.
Once&mdash;three months after my departure from the
cottage&mdash;I had stolen down in the darkness of
evening to watch the shadows on the blinds, and
perhaps catch the sound of a voice still so terribly
dear to me. I saw Philip and Lilian together, and
recognised that they were lovers, and then I knew
that the victory was not yet won.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">{501}</a></span></p>

<p>An hour later some one stooped over me as I
lay crouched in the woods. 'Are you ill? What
is the matter with you, good woman?' said the
familiar voice of Robert Wentworth, as he laid his
hand upon my shoulder. 'It is bad for you to be
lying here this damp night.'</p>

<p>I shrank away, drawing the hood of my cloak
more closely round my face, which I kept turned
away. He stood still a few moments, and then
without another word passed on. I had hitherto
always persuaded myself that he had not recognised
me; but now my cheeks grew uncomfortably
hot with the suspicion that he did know
me, and that the passing silently on was the very
thing which a delicate consideration for me would
prompt him to do. I was only surprised that it
had not occurred to me before. I never had succeeded
in throwing dust into Robert Wentworth's
eyes when I had tried so to do. I knew now that
it was to him Jane Osborne had alluded when she
jested about a certain friend of hers who was so
interested in all that concerned me, and whom I
was to know more about by-and-by. I had sometimes
a little murmured in my heart at having to
give up Robert Wentworth's friendship with other
things, knowing the worth of it, and he had been
watching over me all the time! He had traced
me at once; but respecting my desire to be lost to
them all for a time, he had not obtruded himself
upon me, contenting himself with obtaining an
introduction to Jane Osborne and making friends
with her.</p>

<p>That I had been watched over, had been shewn
to me in more ways than one. I could almost
smile now, holding the key, as I recollected many
a little speech from Jane Osborne which seemed
to breathe some stronger spirit than her own.
Tenderly anxious about me, and inclined to pet
me as she was, she would now and again spur me
on to my work with a few words, which puzzled
me extremely from her lips, but which I now
could see she had been instigated to speak by one
who knew me better than she did. But I had not
much time for reflection; the drive was only three
miles, and the ground very quickly got over by a
couple of spirited horses. It seemed but a few
moments after I had left Robert Wentworth in the
road before I was at home.</p>

<p>It is now time to explain what has doubtlessly
suggested itself to the reader, that I had been
acting as superintendent of the Home for the last
twelve months. Nancy had given me a hint that
Mrs Gower had sent in her resignation of the
office, having amassed a comfortable independence.
My visit to town the day before I left the cottage
had been for the purpose of seeing Mrs Osborne,
the foundress of the Home, and I had the good
fortune to find favour in her sight. She saw that
it was a crisis in my life, and was inclined to be
my friend had we two not needed each other. I
went to stay with her a couple of days until Mrs
Gower's departure, and then was duly installed in
the latter's place.</p>

<p>As I expected that Lilian would hope to trace me
through Nancy, the latter was drafted into Jane
Osborne's establishment for a few weeks. Consequently,
when Lilian made her appearance at the
gates, she was informed that Nancy had gone to
some lady whose address the portress for the nonce
was not acquainted with. As I hoped she would,
Lilian jumped to the conclusion that <i>I</i> was the
lady alluded to, and was thus thrown off the scent
as to my whereabouts.</p>

<p>What shall I say&mdash;what ought I to say about
<i>my</i> management of the Home? I think as little
as possible. But I will say that my success has
been greater than I dared to hope for, although I
have had a great deal to unlearn as well as learn.
All sorts of objections were in the outset made to
what were termed my innovations, and perhaps
they were rather daring; but I was beginning to
be able to reply to objectors by more cogent means
than words.</p>

<p>As to myself&mdash;could anything have been more
delightfully refreshing to a wearied spirit than was
the greeting which I received on entering the long
room on my return that afternoon, a welcome from
twenty smiling faces! It is the long room to
which the reader has been previously introduced,
with a difference; the high brick wall before the
windows is gone, and a light palisading marks the
boundary of the grounds, without obstructing the
view, a very fine one, of the most beautiful part of
Kent. Moreover, the room was to-day <i>en fête</i>;
decorated with flowers and evergreens, and with a
feast, almost as grand as that I had just been a
guest at, spread upon the long tables in honour of
my sister's wedding-day. I do not like to write
the kind words of 'Welcome home' pattered out
around me. Jane Osborne and I went to my
room; and whilst I threw off my finery and
slipped on my brown dress (the only badge of distinction
between me and my protégées on ordinary
days was my mother's ring), I set her mind at rest
as to the state of mind in which I had returned.</p>

<p>After tea we had a reading. Reading aloud or
music on certain evenings of the week, whilst the
inmates worked, was another of my innovations.
That night too we had a new arrival. As I afterwards
learned, she had been sought out specially
to be brought down there, and a new-comer was
always under my particular care, and slept in the
place of honour&mdash;a little room adjoining my own.
Not a little astonished seemed the poor waif when
ushered into our gaily bedecked room, and received
as a welcome guest to our evening's entertainment.
Perhaps my few words to that poor girl when I
bade her good-night was as good a termination to
Philip's wedding-day as could be desired for me.</p>

</div><div>
<h2><a name="A_VISIT_TO_AMAZONIA" id="A_VISIT_TO_AMAZONIA">A VISIT TO AMAZONIA.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Amazon, as is pretty well known, is a river
of great length and more wonderful for its breadth
in South America, entering the Atlantic between
Brazil and Guiana. I am going to speak of
Pará, a Brazilian port not far from the sea, to
which I paid a visit, by what is known as the
Pará estuary. The blue ocean had been left the
day before. Passing some islands bearing clumps
of palms, anchor was dropped in front of the city
of Pará, a gun fired from the bridge, and immediately
a fleet of shore-boats came off, keeping at a
respectable distance, however, until the board of
health, customs, and other formalities usual upon
entering a Brazilian port had been observed; but
no sooner had permission been given, than the
deck was swarming with men seeking fares.</p>

<p>'You wan a boat go ashore, sir?' inquired a
demure swarthy man about fifty, who stood twirling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">{502}</a></span>
his cap in hand; 'cos I take you for five shillins,
carry what you got to hotel; an if you like to give
me anything afterwards, much obliged.'</p>

<p>'That will do!' I returned. And in a few
minutes we were speeding towards the landing-place&mdash;a
flight of wooden steps, crowded with
men and boys, anxious to know the latest home
prices of india-rubber and other products. The
heat was excessive. Not a breath of air stirred on
shore; and although longing to ramble through
the town, I felt it advisable to rest a while first;
so we went direct to the Hotel de Commercio in
the Rua da Industria, kept by M. Leduc, an enterprising
Frenchman. Here, single rooms with food
run from ten to fifteen shillings per diem. The
food is excellent, everything considered; but the
rooms are dirty and unfurnished, having each but
one chair&mdash;invariably broken&mdash;a hammock slung
in a corner, and a hard bed and straw bolster
covered with but one sheet. The sanitary arrangements
too are far from perfect.</p>

<p>Most places are celebrated for something; Pará
is celebrated amongst other things for its bats.
Enormous specimens, a foot or two across the
wings, may be seen banging to and fro about
the veranda and bedrooms; beetles and cockroaches
abound too; but there are places up the
river where these are an infinitely greater plague.</p>

<p>The town of Pará is situated about seventy miles
from the Atlantic. It has several spacious squares,
such as the Praças do Cuartel, marine arsenal,
government palace, and Mercado. If clangour of
bells and cracking of rockets above steeples at high
mass are indicative of religious enthusiasm, the
Paraenses ought to be very devout. They certainly
are not badly off for churches, of which I
counted a considerable number.</p>

<p>The streets in this Brazilian town are laid out at
right angles, upon the American block plan; half-a-dozen
are paved with limestone from Lisbon&mdash;brought
as ballast, which is cheaper than getting it
from Rio Janeiro; and facing the river are a number
of houses three stories high, some with staffs
from upper balconies, from which droop consular
flags. Elsewhere, dwelling-houses are usually one
and two stories only. The favourite colour of Brazilians
is green, and doors and windows, in fact every
kind of wood-work, are as verdant as the forests
that surround the town. Few shops boast of glass
windows, on account of the deteriorative action of
the sun upon goods exposed; but some wholesale
firms exhibit a considerable variety of merchandise
in their tunnel-shaped stores, where clerks are seen
poring over ledgers in their shirt-sleeves. A seawall
running the whole length of the river-frontage
is in course of construction; and when finished, and
the intervening space between it and the shore is
filled up and built upon or paved, the appearance
of the city will be decidedly enhanced, and its
sanitary condition improved; for until recently,
every kind of filth and rubbish was shot into the
river, where at low-tide it generated a miasma
enough to breed a pestilence.</p>

<p>Brazilians of social position rarely bring up
their sons to trade, but strive to gain them
government employ or entrance into one of the
learned professions. It happens, however, that a
university career is essential for the acquisition of
a diploma; and as a large percentage of Brazilian
youth entertain a hearty detestation for books,
indulgent parents openly resort to influence, patronage,
and intrigue, to enable their high-spirited
though wonderfully delicate sons to live on the
imperial exchequer. Paraense tradesmen are chiefly
Portuguese; and it really is astonishing how
rapidly one of these worthies gets on after his
arrival in Pará; for he usually leaves the steerage
of an English vessel with nothing but the clothes
on his back, a strong constitution, and a bag of
consecrated charms suspended from a string round
his neck. Accustomed to hard work and poor fare
at home, he considers himself well off with two
mil reis or four shillings per diem; and as shibé
or farinha and water is very filling, and goes
down with a gusto if seasoned with an onion, he
soon saves enough to purchase a horse and cart,
or maybe send to Lisbon for a stout boat painted
green and red. By thrift and economy his
pile of mil rei notes steadily increases in dimensions;
and one fine morning he opens a provision
store and taberna, and begins to see his
way to fortune. How complacently he smiles as
he pours out vintems-worth of cashaça to negro
labourers! How carefully he weighs bacalhão and
farinha for stout Cafuza women (half Indian and
negro), who balance basins upon the head, smoke
short wooden-stemmed black-bowled pipes, and
walk about bare-footed with light print skirts and
no body! He knows the reckless native has
no thought for the morrow, but spends his money
as fast as it is received.</p>

<p>Shortly after my arrival in Pará I was invited
by Mr Henderson, a Scotch merchant, to take
up my quarters in his charming roçinha at the
outskirts of Nazaré, where I remained a little
over three months. Our house was large and
roomy, with immense wooden window-shutters,
which were kept open from early morning till
we retired at night, so as to admit as much fresh
air as possible. The rainy season had set in,
and every day we were favoured with a tropical
thunderstorm of more or less violence. I often
watched the approach of these storms from the
dining-room balconies of Leduc's hotel, which
command a splendid view of the river. Distant
peals of thunder herald the coming storm, and
gusts of wind that rattle shrunken doors and
whistle through crazy windows, impart a welcome
freshness to the sweltering stagnant air. Steamships
at anchor have their funnels covered with
snowy conical caps, to keep out the deluge;
barges taking in or giving out cargo are hastily
covered with tarpaulin; streets become deserted,
except by vehicles drawn by miserable horses, that
firmly compose themselves for a doze till the
down-pour passes over; while clouds of vultures
fly against the gale, to inhale as much fresh air
as possible after their ghastly repast. A steady
approaching line of dense gray clouds with a ragged
blue fringe diminishes the horizon; thunder-claps
grow louder and more frequent; big drops patter
upon the red-tiled roofs; and then falls a deluge
upon house-tops, that rolls into the streets below
in a perfect cascade. Anything beyond ejaculatory
conversation is quite out of the question, for the
noise is simply deafening; and although, from the
vivid flashes of lightning, we know it is thundering
big-guns, we hear nothing beyond the crash of
rain.</p>

<p>While the tempest lasts we tumble into our
hammocks and endeavour to escape drops that
trickle between the tiles; and in half an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">{503}</a></span>
proceed to the balcony to see how matters look
outside. The storm has passed over, and the
horizon grows clearer; the islands in front are lit
up with rays of golden sunshine, that stream
through rifts in the leaden clouds upon the
emerald expanse of forest; sleepy horses are
awoke by drivers, who hit them over the nose with
a stick and inquire what is ailing; foot-passengers
with coloured umbrellas pick their way tiptoe
amid miniature lakes, seas, and channels that flood
the road; steamboats are the cleaner for their
washing; vultures stand upon houses, palacios, and
churches, with wings outstretched to dry; and
by-and-by in the azure heavens float mountains
of fleecy clouds that playfully emit flashes of
lightning as they collide, until night draws near;
and as the sun sinks beneath the western forests,
pale stars peep forth, proclaiming the close of
another day.</p>

<p>Mr Henderson's house was so far distant from
Pará that no noise reached us from the city excepting
the occasional crack of a rocket, a faint bugle-call,
or gun-fire of a boat announcing the arrival of
a foreign mail. The noise of insect life, especially
during the middle watches of the night, imparted
a sense of loneliness, of being shut out from the
world. There was an incessant hum, chirp, burr,
and whir, and every now and then a bull-frog
would 'Woof, woof!' smaller frogs shout 'Hoy,
hoy, hoy!' night-birds fly over the roof, emitting
weird shrill cries; and what with the kissing
conversation of bats, bites of sanguinary carpanás
or mosquitoes, the tickling sensation of jiggers
in my toes, and the fear of being wound up by a
scorpion, centipede, tarantula, or maybe poisonous
snake, I frequently kept awake till towards morning,
when thoroughly overcome with watching and
fatigue, I would fall into a profound and refreshing
sleep.</p>

<p>At daybreak we always had a cup of delicious
fragrant black coffee; and while the heavy dew
spangled every leaf and blade of grass, I frequently
went for a walk down the newly cut roads into
the forest, when I would be sure to be overtaken
by the early train going out with female slaves
and batches of children of all shades of black,
white, and copper colour, to breathe the cooler
air of the forest glades. In anticipation of the
probable extension of the city, an immense area of
forest has been divided into blocks by spacious parallel
avenues, to be intersected by streets at equidistant
right angles. The open spaces are covered
with short capim or grass; but however much one
may delight to stroll about in the shade, he is
sure to have his legs covered with an almost invisible
mite called moquim, that causes an itch
almost enough to drive one frantic, especially at
night; and very likely a number of carrapatos into
the bargain. It is dangerous to scratch where
moquim have settled, for running sores difficult to
heal usually follow. I have seen Europeans and
North Americans from the States with legs in a
frightful condition, in fact lamed through scratching
the skin till sore. An immediate, agreeable,
and effectual remedy against moquim, though they
be ever so numerous, is to sponge the body with
cashaça, the common white rum of the country.
Carrapatos differ in size. These tiny pests are
about as large as a pin's head; and the horse
tick about three or four times larger still. Both
settle upon the clothes, or crawl up the legs,
laying hold of the flesh with serrated fangs, and
adhering so tenaciously that it is impossible to
remove them entire; and to leave a portion sticking
to the skin is certain to produce an ugly sore.
The best way to get rid of this loathsome acaride
is to sponge it well with spirits of any kind, when
it will soon drop off; a hint which may be useful
to Europeans who are pestered with harvest-bugs.</p>

<p>The forest round Pará naturally strikes a European
as superlatively grand. It is only, however,
upon interior high lands that vegetation attains
the height, dimensions, and luxuriance that captivate
and bewilder the senses. It wholly differs
from anything found in temperate climes; and the
stranger never tires of new forms of life and beauty
that momentarily meet his gaze, and indicate an
exuberance and prodigality surpassing his grandest
ideal home conceptions. Accustomed only to individual
forms as seen in home conservatories, the
mind becomes bewildered when countless specimens
of equatorial growth are massed together. Instead
of gnarled and knotted oaks whose venerable
appearance denote centuries of battle against
fierce autumn storms and icy northern blasts, there
is a lithe youthfulness even about veritable giants;
and though a tree may be dead and hollow within,
luxuriance of verdant parasitical plants lends a
charming illusion, and hides the fact from view.
Light, heat, air, and moisture are essential for
the proper development of the richer forms of
parasitical life; hence on water frontage and in
some of the quiet avenues where I loved to
stroll, I observed exhibitions of lavish profusion
which rather resembled the dreams of fairyland
than the realities of actual life. In one
spot, a compact mass of tiny foliage would drape
a number of lofty trees to the ground; in another,
eccentrically arranged festoons and garlands
sprinkled with occasional scarlet and violet passion-flowers
decorated some hundreds of feet
without a single break; while further on, endless
picturesque, artistic, and graceful combinations
ravished the sight, and awoke reverential and
exquisitely happy emotions.</p>

<p>On both sides of avenues near the trees the ground
is closely covered with beautiful lycopodium moss.
Its favourite place of growth is on shady clearings,
though it seems to grow best where timber has
been burned on the ground. A foreigner desirous
of learning how to take forest bearings without a
compass cannot do better than cut his way into
one of the furthest blocks in the district beyond
Nazaré. He knows he cannot be lost, from the fact
of roads existing on every side; hence he may go
to work deliberately, and be under no apprehension
as to result. In these spots where undergrowth
has not been touched will be found solitary
specimens of the curuá, a pretty ground-palm
that shoots a number of long fronds from the
centre, in which stands a smooth slender spathe,
employed in thatching. The broken stems of slim
palms shew where young assaís have been cut down
for the sake of bunches of cherry-looking fruit
employed in the manufacture of a refresco. Assaí
is drunk by everybody in Amazonia when they can
get it, at all hours of the day and before and after
meals. Five or six gallons of the fruit, each about
the size of a marble, are usually piled in a large iron
basin containing a requisite proportion of water;
the mass is then worked over and over till the
outer pulpy skin is worked off; the bare kernels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">{504}</a></span>
are taken out, and at the bottom remains a rich
violet-coloured liquid, that may be imbibed <i>ad lib.</i>
It is best mixed with farinha seca and sugar, and
eaten with a spoon. A liking for it is soon acquired,
and it is not considered good taste to refuse a cuya
or calabash of assaí when offered by a lady.</p>

<p>Every shrub, plant, and tree, and almost every
blade and leaf of grass, is covered with insect life.
Ants are the most common, and meet the eye
everywhere. It is impossible to go far without
coming across tumuli of hard mud four feet high;
and huge coffee-coloured excrescences standing out
upon the trunks of trees indicate where copim
or white ants have taken up their abode. A few
days after my arrival at Mr Henderson's, I noticed
the front of our house was covered with what
appeared to me to be streaks of mud; and feeling
convinced they had not been there the day before,
I proceeded to examine them, and found the lines
were neatly constructed covered-ways. Myriads
of white ants were travelling backwards and forwards;
and no doubt a colony had made up its
mind to devour as much of the wood-work as possible,
and by way of change, shew students how
to rapidly get through and digest good books. I
saw two volumes of <i>Chambers's Information</i> which
had been drilled by these indefatigable workers
as neatly as though the holes had been punched
by an awl. The covered-way hides the workers
from quick-sighted insectivorous birds, especially
woodpeckers. Domestic fowls, lizards, toads,
armadillos, and tamanduas destroy vast numbers.
The largest and most numerous ants I have
seen were in the Campos between the Xingú and
Tapajóz. Near the hill-slopes a few miles from
Santarem, it is simply impossible to preserve a
house from attack, and very frequently a huge nest
actually hangs from the ridge-pole. The ant, however,
which attracts most attention is the saúba.
It marches in columns, each member carrying a
triangular or circular section of a leaf larger than
itself. The only way to turn them from a garden
is by sweeping the track with a flaming branch
for a distance of forty or fifty yards; but as new
excursions will probably be made during the
night, one often finds that they have paid a visit
and departed, leaving perhaps a favourite orange
tree entirely denuded of foliage. A big ant
called the tucandera is very common just outside
Pará; indeed it is hardly possible to walk
many yards in the forest without meeting it: the
bite inflicts excruciating agony. I have never
been stung by a scorpion or bitten by a centipede;
but I have been nipped by a tucandera, and can
quite believe that the pain inflicted is more severe
than that of either of the two former.</p>

<p>What with the uproar of çicadas, chirping of
grasshoppers, screaming of parrots, cawing of
aráras or macaws (the cry of this splendidly
plumaged bird closely resembles ára, arára, hence
its name), plaintive notes of japím and toucans,
and numerous other indescribable sounds, the
attention of the new-comer is kept continually upon
the <i>qui vive</i> until eleven o'clock, when the intense
oven-like heat warns him it is time to return.
Emerging from the forest into one of the avenues
the sun will be found nearly overhead; lizards of
all sizes&mdash;that is to say from three inches to four
feet in length&mdash;dart across the path and scuttle
into the bush; and here and there a snake has
to be guarded against, and if need be killed, with
the short sapling which every pedestrian ought
to carry. Upon reaching home I usually took a
bath, had a substantial breakfast, and rested till
the unfailing thunderstorm cooled the atmosphere.</p>

<h2><a name="A_QUEER_CLUE" id="A_QUEER_CLUE">A QUEER CLUE.</a></h2>

<p class='ph3'>IN TWO CHAPTERS.&mdash;CHAPTER II.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> left the police altogether, and was living
very comfortably, my good lady and I, up at
Islington, in the same street with my married
daughter, who was doing very comfortably too,
her husband having a good berth in the City. I
had always been of a saving turn, and had bought
two or three houses; so with a tidy pension, which
I had earned by thirty years' service, I could
afford to go about a bit and enjoy myself. Of
course in all that time I had made the acquaintance
of a good many professional people; and there
were very few theatres or exhibitions that I couldn't
get admission to. We&mdash;my wife and I, I mean&mdash;made
it a rule to go everywhere that we could get
tickets for; and whether it was the launch of a
ship, the charity children at St Paul's, or Sam
Cowell at the Canterbury Hall, it didn't matter
to us; we went. And it was at the Canterbury I
first had the Combestead murder more particularly
recalled to my mind.</p>

<p>I was there by myself, the old lady not being
willing to leave my married daughter&mdash;because,
well, it was in consequence of her being a married
daughter&mdash;so I went by myself. There was a
young woman who sang a comic version of <i>There's
a good Time coming</i> splendidly; and as I was
always of a chatty turn, I couldn't help remarking
to the person that was sitting next to me how first-class
she did it, when he exclaimed: 'Hollo! why,
never! Superintendent Robinson?' And then
he held out his hand.</p>

<p>It was young Lytherly, but so stout, and brown,
and whiskery&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;that I didn't know
him.</p>

<p>'Mr Lytherly!' I exclaimed, 'I didn't expect to
see <i>you</i>; and you're right as to my being Robinson,
although police officer no longer. Why, I thought
you were in the army.'</p>

<p>'So I was,' he returned; 'but I'm out of it now;
and I'll tell you how it was.'</p>

<p>It seems he had been to India, and got some
promotion after three years' service; and had the
good fortune to save his colonel from drowning, or
what was more likely in those parts, being taken
down by a crocodile, under circumstances of extraordinary
bravery. He did not tell me this last bit,
but I heard so afterwards. Lytherly was always a
wonderful swimmer, and I remembered his taking
a prize at London. The exertion or the wetting
brought on a fever, and he was recommended for
his discharge. The colonel behaved most liberally.
But what was the best of all, the old fellow who
kept the canteen at the station died about this
time, and Lytherly had been courting his daughter
for a good bit, more to the girl's satisfaction than
that of her father; so then they got married, and
came home to England, and he was tolerably well
off. He naturally talked about the Combestead
murder, and said frankly enough, that&mdash;except the
people with whom he lodged, and <i>they</i> were suspected,
he said, of perjury&mdash;he thought I was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">{505}</a></span>
only person in the town who did not believe him
guilty of the murder.</p>

<p>'But murder will out, Mr Robinson,' he said;
'and you will see this will be found out some day.'</p>

<p>'Well, I am sure I hope it will, Mr Lytherly,' I
answered him. 'But as for "murder will out" and
all that, I don't think you will find any policeman
or magistrate who will agree with you there; and
there was less to help us when you had got out of
the scrape in this Combestead business, than any
affair I was ever concerned in.'</p>

<p>'I don't care,' he says; 'it will come out, Mr
Robinson. I dream of it almost every night; and
my wife consulted some of the best fortune-tellers
in India, and they all told her it would be discovered.'</p>

<p>'Hum!' I said; 'we don't think much of fortune-tellers
here, you know.'</p>

<p>'I'm perfectly aware of that,' he says; 'and I
shouldn't give them in as evidence; but if you had
lived three years in India with people who knew
the native ways, you might alter your mind about
fortune-tellers. Anyway, you will remember, when
it's found out, that I told you how it would be.'</p>

<p>I laughed, and said I should; and after we had
had another glass together, and he had given me
his address and made me promise to call on him,
we parted.</p>

<p>I told my wife all about it; and it is very curious
to see how women are all alike in curiosity and
superstition and all that; for although my wife
had been married to me for thirty years, and so
had every opportunity of learning better, yet she
caught at what young Lytherly&mdash;not so very young
now, by-the-by&mdash;had said about these fortune-tellers,
and was quite ready to believe and swear
that the murder would be found out. It's no use
arguing with a party like that; so I merely smiled
at her, and passed it off.</p>

<p>It was the very next day that Mrs Robinson and
myself had agreed to go and see a new exhibition
of paintings which some one was starting in
London, and tickets were pretty freely given away
for it; but the same reason which stopped my
wife from going to the Canterbury, stopped her
from going to the exhibition. I went, of course,
because <i>I</i> couldn't be of any use, under the circumstances,
to my married daughter; and a very good
exhibition it was too. There were plenty of paintings,
and I had gone through all the rooms and
entered the last one. There were very few persons,
I was sorry to see, in the place, so that you could
have an uninterrupted view of any picture you
pleased. After glancing carelessly round the room,
for one gets a kind of surfeited with pictures after
a bit, I was struck by a gloomy-looking painting to
the left of the doorway, and which I had not
noticed on my first entry. When I came to look
closer into it, I was more than struck&mdash;I was
astounded. It was a picture representing the finding
of old Trapbois the miser, in the <i>Fortunes of
Nigel</i>. The heavy dull room was lighted only by
the candle which the young nobleman held above
his head; and it appeared to be excellently painted.
But what drew my attention was that, as a part of
the confusion in which the struggle between the old
man and his murderers had placed the room, the
washstand had been upset, had fallen into the
fireplace, and the ewer had rolled into the grate,
where it was shewn as unbroken, although the
water was flooding the boards&mdash;all exactly as I had
seen the same things five years before&mdash;so exactly,
that I was perfectly sure no chance coincidence
had produced the resemblance, but that whoever
had painted this picture had seen the room where
Miss Parkway was murdered, and had had the
features of the scene stamped on his memory.
Who so likely to have the scene so stamped, I
instantly thought, as the murderer himself? As
this rushed on my mind, I could not repress an
exclamation, although pretty well guarded as a
rule. The only other person in the room heard me,
and came to see what had excited me so strongly.
Apparently, he was disappointed, for he looked
from the picture to his catalogue, then to the
picture again, then at me, back to his catalogue, and
then went away with a discontented grunt. I did
not move, however, but remained quite absorbed in
the study of this mysterious painting; and the
more I looked, the more convinced I became that
it was copied from the scene of Miss Parkway's
murder. There were several little points which I
had not at first noticed, and in fact had quite forgotten;
such as the position of the fire-irons, the
direction in which the water had run, and so forth,
which were all faithfully shewn in the picture.
To be brief, I had made up my mind before I
left the room that I had at last found the real
clue to the Combestead murder.</p>

<p>The artist's name was Wyndham; and I determined
that I would very soon, as a natural
beginning, make some inquiries about this Mr
Wyndham; and indeed I began before I left the
exhibition. I engaged the hall-keeper to have a glass
with me at the nearest tavern, and when I got
fairly into conversation with him, asked carelessly
where Mr Wyndham lived, as I thought I had
known him many years ago, giving a description of
some entirely imaginary person. The hall-keeper
said: 'No&mdash;that was not the sort of man at all. Mr
Wyndham was' (here he described him); 'and he
doesn't live at the west-end of London, as you said,
sir, but at a place in Essex, not very far from
Colchester.' He knew where he lived, because he
had several times posted letters to him at 'The
Mount.' This was about all I got from the hall-keeper,
but it was as much as I wanted.</p>

<p>I am not greatly in the habit of taking other
people into my confidence, but this was altogether
an exceptional case; so, after a little reflection, I
went straight to the address John Lytherly had
given me, and told him what I had seen. He of
course introduced me to his wife, a very pretty
dark-eyed young woman; and when I had told all,
they exchanged looks less of surprise than triumph.
'Oh, it is coming all right!' he exclaimed. 'I
knew the murder would cry out some day. And
now you will have a little more respect for Indian
fortune-tellers.'</p>

<p>'I am not quite sure about that,' I said. 'But
don't you go making so certain that we are going
to find out anything, Mr Lytherly: this may be
only an accidental resemblance.' Because, as you
may suppose, I had not told them how confident
I felt in my own mind.</p>

<p>'Accidental! Nonsense!' was all he said to
that; and then he asked me what was the first
step I proposed to take. I told him that I thought
we ought to go down to this village and see
if we could learn anything suspicious about Mr
Wyndham; and by my old detective habits,
and the way in which the officers about would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">{506}</a></span>
sure to help me, I thought we might reckon on
finding out what was wanted. He was delighted,
and asked when we should start, and when I
said that very night, he was more delighted still.</p>

<p>It is always my rule to strike the iron while it's
hot, and nothing could possibly be got by waiting
now; so I had made up my mind just to run home,
get a few things in my bag, and go down by the
ten o'clock train. My wife, you may be sure, was
very much astonished; but, as I expected she would
be, was just as confident in the murder being found
out as young Lytherly himself. Of course the
latter was ready. And we were put down at our
destination about twelve o'clock; too late for anything
that night, but still we were on the spot to
begin the first thing in the morning. And accordingly
directly after breakfast we began. John
Lytherly would have begun before breakfast, but
as an old hand I knew better than that; because
the party we were after, allowing he was the right
party, after a five years' rest, wasn't going to bolt
now; so it was no case for hurrying and driving.
Well, soon after breakfast, I sauntered into the
bar, and began talking with the landlord, who was
an elderly sort of party about my own age, and
who bragged&mdash;as if it was a thing to be proud of&mdash;before
we had talked three minutes, that he had
lived, man and boy, in Chumpley, which was the
name of the lively place, for more than fifty years.</p>

<p>'Then you're just the fellow for me,' I thought;
and then began talking of an old master of mine
who was now living somewhere down in this
neighbourhood, by the name of Wyndham.</p>

<p>'Wyndham? Let me see; Wyndham?' says
the landlord, putting on his wisest look. 'No; I
can't remember any party of that name. There's
Wilkinson, and Wiggins; perhaps it's one of
them.'</p>

<p>I told him they would not do; and then added,
that the party I meant was something of an artist,
painted pictures partly for pleasure and partly for
profit. This was only a guess of mine, but it was
a pretty safe one.</p>

<p>'Oh! there's lots of <i>them</i> about here!' exclaims
the old boy, grinning very much, as if it was a
capital idea. 'There's Mr De Lancy Chorkle,
Miss Belvidera Smith, Mrs Galloon Whyte, Mr
Hardy Canute, and a lot more; but I don't think
there's a Wyndham.'</p>

<p>'Ah, well, it don't matter,' I said, very carelessly
still; 'I may be mistaken. I heard, however, he
lived down here at a place called the Mount. Is
there such a place?'</p>

<p>'Is there such a place!' says the landlord, with
as much contempt in his voice as if I ought to be
ashamed of myself for not knowing. 'Yes, there is;
and a first-rate gentleman artist lives there too; but
his name ain't Wyndham; his name happens to be
Parkway, sir, Mr Philip Parkway; though I have
heard that he is too proud to paint under his own
name.'</p>

<p>'I think, landlord,' I said, 'that I'll have just
three-penn'orth of brandy, cold;' which I took,
and left him without another word, for when I
heard this name, I felt struck all of a heap,
because it made a guess into a certainty, though in
a way I had never dreamt of. I couldn't even go
back to Lytherly for a little while; it was all so
wonderful; and I was so angry with myself for
never having thought at the time that the man who,
of all others in the world, had the most to gain by
the poor woman's death, might have been the one
who killed her. In the bitterness of my feeling I
could not help saying that any one but a detective
would have pounced upon this fellow at the first.
However, I got over the vexation, and went back
to Lytherly to tell him my news. We were each
very confident that we had the right scent now;
but yet it was not easy to see what we were to do.
I could not very well apply for a warrant against
a man because he had painted a picture; and so we
walked and talked until we could think of nothing
better than going down to Combestead, and with
our fresh information to help us, seeing if we could
not rake up something there.</p>

<p>We came to this resolution just as we reached a
toll-gate, close by which stood a little house, which
appeared to be the beer-shop, baker's, post-office,
and grocer's for the neighbourhood. Not much of
a neighbourhood, by-the-by, for, excepting a few
gentlemen's seats, there was hardly another house
within sight. One small but comfortable-looking
residence, we were informed by the chatty old lady
who owned the 'store,' was the Mount, where Mr
Parkway lived. He was a very retired, silent sort of
a gentleman, she said, and people thought his wife
didn't have the happiest of lives with him. He
had been married for a few years, the old lady
went on; soon after a relation had died, and left
him a good bit of money. Before that he only
rented apartments in the village; but then he
married Miss Dellar, who was an orphan, with a
good bit of money too, but quite a girl to him,
and they went to live at the Mount. At this point
the old lady broke suddenly off, and said: 'Here
they are!' going to the door immediately, and
dropping her very best courtesy. We followed her
into the little porch; and there, sure enough, was a
low carriage, drawn by one horse, and in it sat a
gloomy dark man, whom I had no difficulty in
recognising, and by his side a slight, very pretty,
but careworn-looking young woman. Mr Parkway
looked coolly enough at us, and we as carelessly
returned his glance, for we were both so much
changed since the Combestead days, that there was
little fear of his remembering us.</p>

<p>It seemed they had called about a servant
which the post-office keeper was to have recommended,
and Mrs Parkway alighted from the
carriage to write some memorandum on the
business. Parkway had never spoken, and I
thought I could see in his harsh features traces of
anxiety and remorse. Lytherly had followed Mrs
Parkway into the shop, and, as I could see from
where I stood, on the lady asking for a pen, he
drew his gold pencil-case from his pocket, and
offered it, as probably containing a better implement
than any the post-office could afford. The
lady stared, looked a little startled, but after a
moment's hesitation accepted it with a very sweet
smile. While Mrs Parkway was engaged in writing
her letter, Lytherly stood by her side, and
sauntered out after her. I had been waiting in the
porch, watching her husband, whose face was so
familiar to me that I half expected to see a look of
recognition come into his eyes; but nothing of
the sort happened. Lytherly watched them drive
off, then turning suddenly round, exclaimed: 'It's
as good as over, Robinson! We've got them!'</p>

<p>'Why, what is there afresh?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Just sufficient to hang the scoundrel,' said
Lytherly. 'You remember, of course, that among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">{507}</a></span>
other things which were stolen on the night of the
murder was a curious locket which poor Miss
Parkway used to wear, and that some fragments of
the chain were afterwards found.'</p>

<p>I remembered this very well, and told him so.</p>

<p>'Very good,' he continued. 'I gave that locket
and chain to the poor old girl: it was the only
valuable I possessed in the world; and Mrs Parkway
has the central carbuncle in her brooch now.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense!' I exclaimed, not knowing exactly
what I did say at the moment.</p>

<p>'It is a fact,' he said; 'and I can swear to it.
What is more to the point, perhaps, is, that
although the stone is in a strange setting, and no
one but myself, probably, could recognise it, yet I
can identify it. On the side are my initials cut in
almost microscopical characters. If they are there,
that settles it; if they are not, put me down as an
impostor, and fix the murder on me if you like.'</p>

<p>There was a good deal more said after this, but the
upshot of it was that we went over to Colchester,
and laid the matter before the authorities; when
after a little hesitation, a warrant was granted for
the apprehension of Mr Philip Parkway; and two
officers, accompanied by Lytherly and myself,
went over to execute it.</p>

<p>It was after nightfall when we arrived at the
Mount; and on knocking at the door, we found
that Mr Parkway was in; but his wife was out,
having gone up (so the elderly woman that was
called by the footboy informed us), to play the
harmonium at the weekly rehearsal of the village
choir. 'About the only amusement she has, poor
thing,' the woman muttered, and she seemed in a
very bad temper about something. We said we
wanted to see her master, and that she need
not announce us. And, as I live, I believe
that woman guessed directly who we were, and
what we had come for. At anyrate, quite a glow
of triumph came into her face, and she pointed to
a door nearly opposite to where we stood. We
opened it, and found ourselves in a sort of large
study, where, seated at a table, reading, was the
man we wanted. He looked up in surprise as we
entered, and the light falling strongly on his face,
while all the rest of the room was in darkness, I
thought I saw a paleness come and go on his
gloomy features; but that might have been fancy.</p>

<p>'What is your business?' he began; but Mr
Banes the chief constable cut him short.</p>

<p>'I am sorry to inform you, Mr Parkway,' he
said, 'that I hold a warrant for your arrest, and
you must consider yourself in custody.'</p>

<p>Parkway stared at him, mechanically closed
the book he was reading, and said: 'On what
charge, sir?'</p>

<p>'For murder,' says Banes; and then I was sure
Parkway did turn very white. 'For the murder
of Miss Parkway, at Combestead, in 186-.'</p>

<p>Parkway looked from one to the other of us for
a few seconds without speaking; at last his eyes
settled for an instant on Lytherly; then turning to
Banes, he said, pointing straight at Lytherly: 'It
was that man, I have no doubt, who set you on.'</p>

<p>'You had better not say anything, sir,' said the
chief constable, 'but just give your servants what
orders you wish, and come with us, as we
cannot stop.'</p>

<p>'I daresay it was he,' continued Parkway,
not answering Mr Banes, but seeming to go with
his own thoughts. 'I fancied he was dead, for
what I took to be his ghost has been in my room
every night for this month past.&mdash;Where is my
wife?'</p>

<p>We told him she was not at home, and that we
were anxious to spare her as far as possible; but
he gave such a bitter smile, and said: 'She will
certainly be vexed to have had a husband that
was hanged; but she will be glad to be a widow on
any terms.'</p>

<p>We didn't want to hear any more of this, so got
him away; not without some little trouble though;
and if there had not been so many of us, we should
have had a scene; as it was, we were obliged to
handcuff him.</p>

<p>The servants, four of them, were naturally
alarmed, and were in the hall when we went out.
Mr Parkway gave a very few directions, and the
elderly woman grinned quite spitefully at him.</p>

<p>'Don't insult the man, now he's down,' I said
in a whisper, while Parkway and the two officers
got into the fly. Lytherly and I were to ride
outside and drive.</p>

<p>'Insult <i>him</i>! the wretch!' she said. 'You don't
mean to suppose <i>he</i> has any feelings to hurt. He
has been trying to drive my poor young mistress&mdash;that
I nursed when a baby&mdash;into her grave, and
he would have done it, if I had not been here.
The only excuse is, he is, and always has been, a
dangerous lunatic.'</p>

<p>We drove off, and I saw no more of her, and
never heard how Mrs Parkway took the intelligence.</p>

<p>The lady was present at the preliminary examination;
and to her great surprise her carbuncle
brooch was taken from her and used against her
husband. This examination was on the next
morning, and we obtained more evidence than we
had at first expected. Not only was the carbuncle
marked as Lytherly had said it would be, but I
had been up at the station, being unable to shake
off old habits, and had made some inquiries there.
Strangely enough, the man who was head-porter
now had been head-porter there five years ago (it
is a very sensible way railways have of keeping a
good man in the same position always; promotion
generally upsets and confuses things); and he was
able, by secondary facts, to fix the dates and to
shew that not only did Mr Parkway go to Combestead
for the funeral, but that he went to London
and back just before; from London, of course, he
could easily get to Combestead, and his absence
left him about time to do so. We proposed then
to have a remand and get evidence from Combestead;
but it was never needed.</p>

<p>Parkway had been expecting this blow for years,
and always kept some deadly poison concealed in
the hollow of his watch-seal. This he took, on
the night after his examination, and was found
dead in his cell by the officer who went the
rounds. He first wrote a very long and minute
confession, or rather justification, shewing that his
motive had been to prevent his cousin's marriage
with Lytherly, whom he seemed to hate very
much, although the young man had never harmed
him. He said he went expressly to Combestead to
get possession of the money his misguided relative
had drawn, and to kill her. He felt that if he left
her alive, she would carry out her scandalous plan,
and therefore it was his duty to kill her; so in
doing this he felt he had committed no crime,
but had only been an instrument of justice. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">{508}</a></span>
I suppose he was, as the housekeeper declared, a
dangerous lunatic.</p>

<p>However, the reward of one hundred pounds
had never been withdrawn, and I got it; it was
paid out of Parkway's estate too, which was about
the strangest go I ever heard of. Lytherly and his
wife are great friends with Mrs Robinson and
myself; indeed we have usually one of their young
ones staying with us, when we haven't one or
two from my married daughter. Mrs Parkway, I
heard, sold off at the Mount, and went away; and
some time after I saw by the papers that she was
married to some one else. I hope she made a
better match the second time.</p>

<p>On the whole, on looking back I am inclined to
think that of all the clues by which I ever found
anybody out, this was really the queerest.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
</div><div>
<h2><a name="THE_MONGOOSE" id="THE_MONGOOSE">THE MONGOOSE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> some time ago published an account of that
deadly snake the Cobra, from the pen of a now
well-known writer on Indian sports. In that
paper it was given as the opinion of Dr Fayrer,
author of a splendid work on Indian poisonous
serpents, that a human being if bitten by a cobra
in full vigour, was entirely beyond the reach of
any known antidote; death was certain. In the
following paper, which is from the pen of the
author of the article above mentioned, some
curious facts are adduced relative to the mongoose
or ichneumon, an animal which is credited in
many parts of India with being proof against
snake-bite! With these few words of introduction,
we leave our sporting friend to describe the
little creature.</p>

<p>In countries where snakes and other noxious
reptiles abound, nature, as a means of checking the
excessive increase of such plagues, has provided
certain animals, both biped and quadruped, which,
by continually preying upon and destroying
snakes of all kinds, both large and small, fulfil
a most useful office, and confer an inestimable
benefit on man. The peccary of South America,
a small but fearless species of the hog-tribe,
will not flinch from an encounter with such a
terrible foe as the deadly rattlesnake; but encased
in a hide of extreme toughness, quickly despatches
and devours his scaly antagonist. The Secretary
bird of Southern Africa, belonging to the falcon
tribe, habitually subsists on reptiles of all kinds.
In Europe the stork acts a similar part; and many
other useful birds and beasts, performing the same
good work, might be mentioned.</p>

<p>In India, where serpents are specially common
and destructive to human life, we have various
kinds of snake-devourers, such as storks and cranes
and the well-known adjutant. Peafowl are especially
active in destroying small descriptions of
snakes; and others of the feathered race assist in
the work. But in general, animals of all kinds
have a natural dread, and carefully avoid permitting
themselves to come in contact with, or even
close proximity to a member of the snake-tribe,
instinctively aware of the danger of meddling
with such creatures.</p>

<p>The little ichneumon (a Greek word signifying
a follower of the tracks or footsteps) or mongoose
of India, is, however, a bright exception to
this rule, for not only will he, when so disposed,
without fear of consequences readily enter into
mortal combat with the most venomous descriptions
of snakes, but will even seek them out,
attack, slay, and devour them, their young, or eggs,
in their various strongholds and hiding-places.</p>

<p>The common gray mongoose (<i>Herpestes griseus</i>),
called by the natives of Northern India 'Néwelá,'
is exceedingly abundant everywhere. In general
shape and contour, though not in colour, it is much
like a ferret, and in many other ways resembles
one of the weasel tribe. In size it is considerably
larger than a ferret; and the hair which covers the
body, instead of lying smooth and feeling soft to
the touch, as that of the ferret, is coarse and
bristly. The colour, which varies much in different
parts of the country and according to the
season of the year, is generally of a reddish brown,
speckled over with gray. Its length from tip of
nose to tip of tail is about two feet. The snout is
sharply pointed, ears short and round, eyes small
and piercing; the jaws are armed with a formidable
set of teeth, the canines being especially
sharp and long.</p>

<p>The mongoose frequents gardens, thick hedgerows,
and scrub jungle; and if left unmolested,
and not hunted by dogs, will often take up its
abode in some burrow or hole in a bank in close
proximity to inhabited buildings. Though in
general nocturnal in habits, yet it may often be
seen crossing a road or footpath during the day,
usually pausing a moment to look around and
make sure that the coast is clear of dogs and suchlike
enemies before venturing to cross open ground.
It possesses in common with the weasel tribe the
habit of constantly sitting up on its hind legs to
listen or obtain a better view around. I never,
however, have observed it <i>feeding</i> in this position,
like a squirrel, as has been stated to be the case.
The mongoose has not the wandering propensities
of the weasel tribe, one day here, the next miles
away, but takes up its residence and remains in
one particular spot, to which it returns, after
roaming through the country around in search of
food. A single animal, sometimes a pair, is
usually seen at a time, seldom more; and I have
never myself beheld, or heard of, large numbers
travelling together, as we know stoats and weasels
not unfrequently do. Though seldom if ever
known to ascend trees, even when pursued by an
enemy, the little creature may frequently be seen
hunting about on the roofs of outhouses or deserted
buildings of no great height, to which it
has ascended probably by means of holes in the
walls; but strictly speaking, the mongoose is not
a climber, like the squirrel and marten.</p>

<p>Our little friend has been described as an excellent
swimmer; but I imagine that it does not
readily take to water, for I have never seen it
swimming across streams or pools, though the
banks of rivers, especially when honeycombed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">{509}</a></span>
rat-holes, and affording cover to the animal's
usual prey, are much frequented by it. It is an
exceedingly courageous creature, and capable of
inflicting severe punishment on animals far larger
than itself, with its formidable teeth. A full-grown
and powerful Tom-cat belonging to my
regiment, the terror of all the squirrels in the
neighbourhood, was worsted and most severely
mauled in an encounter of his own seeking with
a harmless mongoose. The latter surprised in the
first instance and hard pressed by his opponent,
turned on his assailant, and bit him through the
face, inflicting so severe a wound, extending as it
did from the corner of the eye to the mouth, that
the aggressor was compelled to beat a retreat,
having caught a regular Tartar. For many weeks
we all thought that the sight of the injured
optic was destroyed, though eventually the contrary
proved to be the case; but puss for ever
after carefully avoided seeking a quarrel with
such an undaunted little champion.</p>

<p>The mongoose at times is mischievous; and
not unfrequently during the night invades the
poultry-yard; and when intent on making an
entrance into a hen-roost, is a difficult thief to
keep out, for the creature manages to creep through
very small openings and crevices. Having once
succeeded in forcing its way in, the mongoose, like
many others of its tribe, not content with obtaining
a single fowl sufficient to furnish a hearty
meal, is given to the bad habit of slaying half
a dozen or more unfortunates, which it never
attempts to carry off, but leaves scattered about
the floor.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of such small 'peccadillos'
and insignificant petty thefts, which I believe are
the sum-total of crimes which can be with justice
laid to the charge of the little animal, the mongoose,
on account of its many admirable qualities
and the exceedingly useful office it fulfils, should
ever be encouraged and protected by man. Not
only does it continually hunt for and prey upon
reptiles of various kinds, devouring their young
and eggs alike, but cobras and other venomous
snakes on becoming aware of such an active and
dreaded little adversary being in their midst,
speedily leave such a neighbourhood, and betake
themselves to other and safer quarters; and as
we know that the smell of a cat suffices to keep
away rats and mice from our dwellings, so in like
manner will a mongoose, by continually prowling
about a house, in a great measure free the premises
from snakes, rats, mice, and such vermin.</p>

<p>The mongoose in its wild state, if kindly treated,
fed with milk, and made a welcome visitant, speedily
loses its natural fear of human beings, and not
only will pass along the veranda of a house, but
if unmolested, soon learns to cross from one room
to another by an open door or window. When
captured young, it is very easily reared and
domesticated, and soon becomes familiarised with
the loss of liberty. It is cleanly in its habits, and
has no offensive odour pertaining to it, like many
of its tribe. It will trot about after its owner
like a dog or cat, and even permit children to
handle or play with it, without attempting to
bite or scratch them. I have seen one curled up
asleep in a lady's lap. They are special favourites
of the British soldiers in the barracks, and dozens
of such pets may be seen in a single building.</p>

<p>Being, as I have already stated, a deadly foe to
the cobra, battles between that formidable reptile
and the mongoose are of constant occurrence; but
I never have had the good fortune to witness a
combat between the two animals in <i>their wild state</i>,
though I have several times seen large and formidable
snakes despatched within a few minutes
of the commencement of the fight, by tame
ichneumons; and I imagine that the tactics employed
on both sides are much the same whether
the champions have casually met in the jungle,
or the duel has been arranged for them by human
beings.</p>

<p>In the various encounters which I have personally
witnessed between mongoose and cobra, the
former invariably came off the victor, and that
without apparently receiving a wound. The little
animal always adopted the same tactics, vigorously
attacking the snake by circling round
it and springing at its throat or head, but at the
same time with wonderful skill and quickness
avoiding the counter-strokes of its dangerous
enemy; till at length waiting for a favourable
opportunity&mdash;when the snake had become to a
certain extent exhausted by its exertions&mdash;the
nimble little quadruped would suddenly dart forward,
and, so to speak, getting under its opponent's
guard, end the fight by delivering a crunching
bite through the cobra's skull.</p>

<p>In none of the half-dozen battles which I have
witnessed has there been an attempt on the
part of the mongoose to 'extract the serpent's
fangs' (as some recent writers have described);
though more than once, after gaining the victory,
the animal has commenced to ravenously devour
its late opponent. Possibly these poor creatures,
that shewed so inordinate a desire for food, had
been intentionally starved for the occasion by their
owners, to make them the more eager to engage
and overcome the cobra so soon as let loose,
and thus without fail or delay to insure a pitched
battle for the benefit of the spectators.</p>

<p>As the reader is probably aware, these combats
between mongoose and cobra have given rise to
many differences of opinion and disputes among
naturalists; though I think that the careful
inquiries and numberless experiments made by
scientific men in late years have done much to
clear up these old points of contention, and at the
same time have put to flight many delusions no
longer tenable. For instance, a common belief
formerly prevailed 'that a mongoose, when bitten
in an engagement with a cobra or other venomous
snake, was in the habit of eating some kind of
plant or root, which altogether nullified the effects
of the poison.' This extraordinary idea yet prevails
in some parts of India among certain classes
of natives, who to this day maintain that the
mongoose, by means of some such specific as I
have mentioned, works a self-cure when bitten
by a venomous reptile. But it is a well-known
fact that many tribes and castes are exceedingly
superstitious and obstinate, pertinaciously clinging
to the convictions, maxims, and customs handed
down to them by their forefathers; and with such
people it is, generally speaking, useless to enter
into an argument.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to consider a second
and far more difficult point to determine, and
which, I think, yet remains a vexed question,
requiring further investigation. I refer to the
supposition, which many maintain, 'that the poison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">{510}</a></span>
from the fangs of venomous snakes, though so
fatal in its results with most living creatures, is
<i>innoxious to the genus to which the mongoose belongs</i>,
and that one of these animals, beyond suffering
pain from the bite of a cobra, sustains no further
harm or inconvenience.'</p>

<p>Many strong and weighty arguments have been
urged in support of this theory; and perhaps the
most remarkable that has ever been brought before
the public appeared many years ago in an article
published in the <i>Churchman's Magazine</i>, entitled
'A Question in Natural History settled at last.'
The writer, after ably sustaining his view of the
question, concludes by publishing at length a
most interesting communication from India, giving
a detailed account of a prolonged and bloody
engagement between mongoose and cobra. This
letter was signed by three officers of the Indian
army, witnesses of the combat, and who vouched
for the strict accuracy of the report. The particulars
of this desperate duel, which actually
lasted three-quarters of an hour, with the various
changes and incidents as the combat proceeded,
are minutely described; but after a gallantly contested
battle, the mongoose proved the victor, and
the cobra was overcome and slain. The former,
however, did not come off scathless, but, on the
contrary, received several wounds, including one
of great severity.</p>

<p>When the encounter was over, the witnesses
proceeded to carefully examine, with a magnifying
glass, the wounds which the mongoose had received,
in order to ascertain and satisfy themselves
of their extent and nature; and mark the important
discovery brought to light by aid of the lens.
I will quote the concluding words of the narrative:
'On washing away the blood from one of
these places the lens disclosed <i>the broken fang of the
cobra deeply imbedded in the head of the mongoose</i>....
We have had the mongoose confined
ever since (now four days ago), and it is now as
healthy and lively as ever.'</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that such clear and trustworthy
evidence as this carries considerable weight
with it, and tends to bear out the writer's view of
the question. On the other hand, to deal impartially,
it is right to point out one or two weak points
in carrying out this otherwise well-conducted experiment,
and which somewhat detract from the
results and consequent opinions arrived at.</p>

<p>In the first place, we are told that the cobra
was only three feet long, undoubtedly a very small
one; and further, that previous to engaging the
mongoose, to make sure that the reptile was in
full possession of its fatal powers, it was made to
bite a fowl, which died soon after. This certainly
clearly proved that the snake's deadly machinery
was in full working order. But the experimentalists
appear to have forgotten that by this very act
they were in a measure disarming the cobra, for
it is a well-known fact that the <i>first</i> bite of a
venomous snake is most to be feared; and that a
second bite by the same reptile, if delivered shortly
after the first, owing to the poison having been
partially exhausted by the first effort, is less deadly
in its effects.</p>

<p>So that, all things considered, and fully allowing
that this account strengthens the assertion that
the mongoose is really proof against the effects
of snake-poison, I am yet of opinion that the question
is not finally and conclusively settled, more
especially as later experiments, quite as fairly and
carefully carried out, have terminated differently,
and resulted in the death of the plucky little
fellow.</p>

<h2><a name="SOME_CURIOUS_COINCIDENCES" id="SOME_CURIOUS_COINCIDENCES">SOME CURIOUS COINCIDENCES.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has often been jocularly said that no family
can have any right to call itself 'old' unless it has
its 'family ghost.' As regards the Highlands of
Scotland, we may substitute for the ghost the inevitable
'doom,' or prediction foretelling future weal
or woe to the family. Almost every old Highland
house has its 'prophecy' of this kind, such as the
Argyll and Breadalbane predictions, the 'Fate of
Seaforth,' the 'Fall and Rise of Macleod,' and
many others well known in the north. The great
majority of the families so gifted have had of course
no events in their history that even the credulity
of their retainers in the past could twist into a
fulfilment of the predictions; but in a few cases
there have been some curious coincidences between
the old traditions and the facts of a later time.</p>

<p>We propose to select one or two well authenticated
instances of such coincidences from among
a mass of Highland superstition in a little book
that has recently been published at Inverness
entitled <i>The Prophecies of the Brahan Seer</i>, by
Alexander Mackenzie (Inverness: A. and W.
Mackenzie). This pamphlet is a collection of
most of the traditionary 'prophecies' attributed
to an apocryphal Ross-shire seer of the seventeenth
century, and which have been handed down by
oral tradition from generation to generation in the
Highlands since that time. In the north, the
popular faith in this prophet <i>Coinneach Odhar</i> or
'Dun Kenneth' and his predictions has been and
is both strong and wide, says Mr Mackenzie, who
thinks the legends worthy of preservation, as an
additional chapter 'both remarkable and curious,
to the already extensive history of the marvellous.'
At anyrate, these legends are of some interest as
illustrations of the superstition and credulity of
the Highlanders of the last century, and perhaps
even of this; but our purpose leaves untouched
the wilder traditions in this collection, and deals
only with two episodes in the histories of two
great families of the north.</p>

<p>Sir Edmund Burke in his <i>Vicissitudes of
Families</i> has a weird chapter on 'the Fate of
Seaforth,' in which he gives at full length the
doom of this family, as pronounced by the 'Warlock
of the Glen' (as Sir Edmund calls Dun
Kenneth), and its fulfilment a century and a half
after it was spoken. Burke seemingly accepts
as fact (as does Mr Mackenzie) the purely mythical
story of the seer and his cruel fate&mdash;how,
being a clansman of Seaforth, and famed for his
prophetic skill, he was called on by his chief's wife
to explain why her husband staid so long in Paris,
whither he had gone on business soon after the
Restoration; how the Warlock, unwilling at first to
tell what his uncanny gift shewed him, at last was
forced to say that the Lord of Kintail was forgetting
home and Lady Isabel in the smiles of
a French lady; how the angry countess, furious
that he should have so slandered his chief before
his clansmen, ordered the seer to be burned to
death&mdash;another instance of the proverbial 'honour'
in which prophets are held in their own country.
As he was dying at the stake, Kenneth uttered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">{511}</a></span>
weird prediction foretelling the downfall of the Seaforths
for Lady Isabel's crime. So runs the legend.
It is quite certain that a prediction regarding the
Seaforth family was well known in the Highlands
long before the days of the last chief of Kintail.
We have Lockhart's authority for the fact that
both Sir Humphry Davy and Sir Walter Scott
knew and believed it. 'I do fear the accomplishment
of the prophecy,' writes Scott in another
place to his friend Morritt of Rokeby, who himself
testifies that he heard it quoted in the Highlands
at a time when Lord Seaforth had two sons both
alive and in good health. This prediction ran,
that the house of Seaforth would fall when there
should be a deaf and dumb earl who should sell
Kintail (the 'gift-land' of his house); that this
earl would have three sons, all of whom he should
survive; that four great Highland lairds, his contemporaries,
should each have certain physical
defects, which were named; that the Seaforth
estates should go to 'a white-hooded lassie from the
East,' who should be the cause of her sister's death.</p>

<p>With all these particulars the facts coincided
exactly. Francis Humberstone Mackenzie, the last
Seaforth, became deaf from an attack of fever
while at school, and latterly also became dumb.
His remarkable life is well known: he raised from
his clan the 78th Highlanders, and subsequently
rose to be a lieutenant-general in the army and
governor of various colonies. Scott, whose great
friend he was, says he was a man 'of extraordinary
talents, who must have made for himself a lasting
reputation, had not his political exertions been
checked by painful natural infirmity.' He was the
happy father of three sons and six daughters, all of
high promise; but the end of his life was darkened
by misfortunes. Two of his sons died suddenly;
and in 1814, William, his last hope&mdash;M. P. for his
native county, and a young man of great abilities&mdash;sickened
of a lingering disease, and died about
the time that losses in the West Indies necessitated
the sale of Kintail. In January following, the old
man, broken-hearted at the loss of his three sons,
died; and then, as Scott says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of the line of Mackenneth remained not a male<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear the proud name of the chiefs of Kintail.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The estates went to his eldest daughter, the widow
of Admiral Sir Samuel Hood, who was on her
way home from India when her father died. The
four Highland lairds, friends of Earl Francis, were
all distinguished by the peculiar personal marks
which were mentioned in the prediction; and to
make the coincidence complete, Lady Hood&mdash;then
Mrs Stewart Mackenzie&mdash;many years afterwards
may be said to have been the innocent cause of her
sister's death, for when she was driving Miss
Caroline Mackenzie in a pony-carriage, the ponies
ran away, the ladies were thrown out, and Miss
Mackenzie killed!</p>

<p>So much for this strange chapter in family
history. Let us now glance at the records of
another family&mdash;equally famous in the Highlands&mdash;where
the prediction, as a whole, has not been
fulfilled, though enough has happened here also to
make the coincidence very striking. Our authority
in this case is the Rev. Norman Macleod, father of
the late Dr Norman Macleod. In the appendix
to Dr Norman's <i>Life</i> by his brother are given a
series of reminiscences dictated in his old age by
their father. He says that in the summer of 1799
he visited Dunvegan Castle in Skye, the old stronghold
of the Macleods. 'One circumstance took
place at the castle on this occasion which I think
worth recording, especially as I am the only person
now living who can attest the truth of it. There
had been a traditionary prophecy, couched in
Gaelic verse, regarding the family of Macleod, which
on this occasion received a most extraordinary
fulfilment. This prophecy I have heard repeated
by several persons.... It was prophesied at least
a hundred years prior to the circumstance I am
about to relate.' This prediction shortly was, that
when 'Norman, the third Norman,' should meet
an accidental death; when the rocks on the coast
of Macleod's country called the 'Maidens' became
the property of a Campbell; when a fox had young
ones in the castle; and when the 'Fairy Banner'
should be for the last time shewn&mdash;the glory of
Macleod should depart for a time; the estates be
sold to others. But that again in the far future
another Macleod should redeem the property and
raise the family higher than ever. Now comes the
curious coincidence told by Mr Macleod.</p>

<p>An English smith at Dunvegan told him one day
that next morning he was going to the castle
to force open the iron chest in which the 'fairy
flag' of the Macleods had lain for ages undisturbed.
Mr Macleod was very anxious to be present, and
at last he got permission from 'the factor,' upon
condition that he told no one of the name of
Macleod&mdash;the chief included&mdash;what was to be done.
The smith tore off the lid of the box, and the
famous old flag was exposed&mdash;'a square piece of
very rich silk, with crosses wrought with gold-thread,
and several elf-spots stitched with great care
on different parts of it.' Very soon after this, Mr
Macleod goes on to say, 'the melancholy news of
the death of the young and promising heir of
Macleod reached the castle. "Norman, the third
Norman," was a lieutenant of H.M.S. the <i>Queen
Charlotte</i>, which was blown up at sea, and he and
the rest perished. At the same time, the rocks
called "Macleod's Maidens" were sold in the course
of that very week to Angus Campbell of Ensay; and
they are still in possession of his grandson. A fox
in possession of a Lieutenant Maclean residing in
the west turret of the castle, had young ones,
which I handled. And thus all that was said in the
prophecy alluded to was so far fulfilled; although
I am glad the family of my chief still enjoy their
ancestral possessions, and the worst part of the
prophecy accordingly remains unverified. I merely
state the facts of the case as they occurred, without
expressing any opinion whatever as to the nature
of these traditionary legends with which they were
connected.'</p>

<p>A coincidence as remarkable as any of these
is the one Mr Wilkie Collins notices in connection
with his novel <i>Armadale</i>. Readers of that
powerful story will recollect what an important
part the fatal effects of sleeping in poisoned and
foul air play in it. They, writes Mr Wilkie Collins,
'may be interested in hearing of a coincidence
relating to the present story which actually
happened, and which in the matter of "extravagant
improbability" sets anything of the same kind
that a novelist could imagine at flat defiance. In
November 1865&mdash;that is to say, when thirteen
monthly parts of <i>Armadale</i> had been published,
and I may add, when more than a year and a
half had elapsed since the end of the story, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">{512}</a></span>
now appears, was first sketched in my note-book&mdash;a
vessel lay in the Huskisson Dock at Liverpool,
which was looked after by one man, who slept
on board, in the capacity of ship-keeper. On a
certain day in the week this man was found dead
in the deck-house. On the next day a second man,
who had taken his place, was carried dying to the
Northern Hospital. On the third day a third ship-keeper
was appointed, and was found dead in
the deck-house, which had already proved fatal to
the other two. <i>The name of that ship was the
Armadale.</i> And the proceedings at the inquest
proved that the three men had all been suffocated
by <i>sleeping in poisoned air</i>.' The case, Mr Collins
goes on to say, 'was noticed&mdash;to give two instances
in which I can cite the dates&mdash;in the <i>Times</i> of
November 30, 1865, and was more fully described
in the <i>Daily News</i> of November 28, in the same
year.'</p>

<h2><a name="MUSHROOM_CULTIVATION_IN_JAPAN" id="MUSHROOM_CULTIVATION_IN_JAPAN">MUSHROOM CULTIVATION IN JAPAN.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> pursuance of a plan commenced a short time
back of furnishing information respecting the
staple products of Japan, their culture or preparation,
Her Majesty's Consul at Yokohama, in his
published Report to the Foreign Office, deals,
among other matters, with the cultivation, &amp;c. of
mushrooms; and as that subject is a novel one
in this country, some brief account of the process
may not be unacceptable to our readers. The best
of the edible species of mushrooms are known to
the Japanese as <i>matsu-také</i> and <i>shü-také</i>. The
difficulties experienced in preserving the former
kind prevent their being available for export,
added to which, even when successfully dried, they
are nearly tasteless; the <i>shü-také</i>, on the other
hand, have this peculiar excellence, that though
they are all but tasteless in their raw state, they
have an extremely fine flavour when they are dried.
The quantity that grows naturally on the decayed
roots or cut stumps of the <i>shü</i> tree is not sufficient
to meet the demand, and consequently much skill
has been brought to bear on their cultivation,
notably by cutting off the trunks of the <i>shü</i> and
other trees, and forcing the growth of the mushrooms
on them. Different varieties of oak are most
in favour with the Japanese for the cultivation of
mushrooms, the one just mentioned being considered
to give the best results. The tree grows
abundantly in warm places with a south-easterly
aspect, and attains a height of about eighteen or
nineteen feet. It is an evergreen, bearing small
acorns, which are steamed and eaten; the wood is
used for making boats' oars, charcoal, &amp;c. Another
oak, the <i>kashiwa</i>, from which mushrooms are
obtained, is also plentiful in warm localities, and
grows to a height of thirty or forty feet; its leaves
are used in cookery, and the wood is in great
demand for divining-sticks. A third description of
oak, the <i>donguri</i>, is found all over the country; and
its acorns, after being pounded and steeped in
water, are made into dumplings.</p>

<p>Mushrooms, we are told, are obtained from any
of the above-mentioned trees in the following
manner: about the beginning of autumn a trunk
five or six inches in diameter is selected and cut
up into lengths of four or five feet; each log is
then split into four pieces; and on the outer bark
slight incisions are made at once with a hatchet,
or else the logs are left till the following spring,
when deep cuts are made in them. Assuming the
former course to have been pursued, the logs, after
having received several slight incisions, are placed
in a wood where they can get the full benefit of
the air and heat; and in about three years they
will have become tolerably rotten in parts. After
the more rotten parts have been removed, they
are placed in a slanting position; and about the
middle of the ensuing spring the mushrooms
will come forth in abundance. After these have
been gathered, the logs are still kept, and submitted
to the following process. Every morning
they are steeped in water, and in the afternoon
they are taken out and beaten with a mallet;
they are then ranged on end in the same slanting
position as before; and in two or three days' time
mushrooms will again make their appearance. In
some places it is the custom to beat the logs so
heavily that the wood swells, and this seems to
induce the growth of mushrooms of more than
ordinarily large size. If, however, the logs are
beaten gently, a great number of small mushrooms
grow up in succession. Another mode of forcing
the growth of mushrooms is to bury the cut logs
at once in the earth, and after the lapse of a year,
to take them out and treat them in the manner
just described.</p>

<p>The mushrooms thus grown are stored in a barn
on shelves ranged along three sides, with braziers
lighted underneath. Afterwards they are put into
small boxes, the bottoms of which are lined with
either straw or bamboo mats; these are placed on
the shelves, and gradually dried with great care.
Another mode of drying mushrooms is to string
them on thin slips of bamboo, which are piled
together near the brazier, the heat being kept in
by inverting a closely woven basket over them.</p>

<p>Of other edible mushrooms in Japan besides the
<i>shü-také</i>, Mr Robertson particularises the following:
The <i>kikurage</i>, which grows in spring, summer,
and autumn, on the mulberry, the willow, and
other trees; it is a small, thin, and soft mushroom,
very much marked at the edge, and of a
brownish tinge. The <i>iwa-také</i>, which grows on
rocks in thick masses. The <i>so-také</i>, a very delicately
flavoured mushroom, which is found on
precipitous crags, and is consequently scarce, owing
to the difficulties attendant upon its collection.
The <i>kawa-také</i>, a funnel-shaped mushroom with a
long hollow stalk, which is found in shady spots
on moorland.</p>

<p>By adopting a somewhat similar plan of forcing
mushrooms in Great Britain, it is quite possible
that growers might find it to their advantage.</p>
